# Lab 02 -- Chapter 01

## Define the followint terms:
* object, refers to a particular instance of a class where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures
* class, A class can be defined as a template/blue print that describes the behaviors/states that object of its type support
* instance, a specific realization of any object
* method, a procedure associated with an object
* signature, is the combination of the method name and the parameter list
* parameter, provides information about method parameters, including its name and modifiers. It also provides an alternate means of obtaining attributes for the parameter
* type, is a generic class or interface that is parameterized over types
* state, is more of a usage pattern than a particular way to define a class's property
* source code, a text listing of commands to be compiled or assembled into an executable computer program
* return value, the return type (or result type) defines and constrains the data type of the value returned from a subroutine or method
* compiler, transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language), with the latter often having a binary form known as object code

## In Chapter 1 we have mentioned the data types int and String. Java has more predefined data types. Find out what they are and what they are used for. To do this, you can check Appendix B, or look it up in another Java book or in an online Java language manual. One such manual is at [http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)

## What are the types of the following values?

* 0, byte
* "hello", string
* 101, binary
* -1, byte
* true, boolean
* "33", byte
* 3.1415, floating literal points

## What would you have to do to add a new field, for example one called name, to a circle object? new Circle()

## Write the header for a method named send that has one parameter of type String, and does not return a value.

## Write the header for a method named average that has two parameters, both of type int, and returns an int value.

## Look at the book you are reading right now. Is it an object or a class? If it is a class, name some objects. If it is an object, name its class.

## Can an object have several different classes? Discuss.
